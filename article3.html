  <h2>The Baltic Way: When Two Million People Joined Hands for Freedom</h2>

  <p>On August 23, 1989, nearly two million people formed a human chain across three countries. The line stretched over 600 kilometers. It ran through Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The event became known as the Baltic Way.</p>

  <p>The demonstration was peaceful and silent. People stood hand in hand on roads, in fields, and through cities. They did not carry weapons. They carried flags, flowers, and candles. Their goal was simple. They wanted independence from the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>The Baltic states had lost their independence during World War II. In 1940, the Soviet Union occupied Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This occupation followed a secret agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The agreement divided Eastern Europe into zones of control.</p>

  <p>For decades, the Baltic nations lived under Soviet rule. Local governments were controlled by Moscow. Free elections did not exist. Speaking openly about independence was dangerous. Many families were deported to Siberia. Cultural traditions were suppressed.</p>

  <p>Despite this, national identity survived. Language, music, and history were preserved quietly. People passed traditions down within families. Songs became a form of resistance. Memory became a form of protest.</p>

  <p>By the 1980s, the Soviet Union began to weaken. Economic problems grew. Political reforms under Mikhail Gorbachev allowed limited freedom of speech. These changes opened space for protest movements across the Baltic region.</p>

  <p>Popular fronts emerged in all three countries. These groups organized rallies and petitions. They demanded recognition of past injustices. They demanded sovereignty. They demanded truth about the occupation.</p>

  <p>The date of August 23 was chosen carefully. It marked fifty years since the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact. The protesters wanted the world to remember that their occupation was not voluntary. It was the result of secret deals between dictators.</p>

  <p>Planning the Baltic Way required coordination across borders. Organizers used radio broadcasts, newspapers, and word of mouth. People were assigned specific locations. Tractors, buses, and cars brought families to rural roads.</p>

  <p>At exactly 7 p.m., people joined hands. For fifteen minutes, the human chain held. Children stood next to grandparents. Farmers stood next to students. Cities and villages became connected.</p>

  <p>Soviet authorities did not intervene. Images of the demonstration spread across the world. Foreign journalists reported on the scale of the event. The message was clear. The Baltic states wanted independence, together.</p>

  <p>The Baltic Way did not bring immediate freedom. Pressure from Moscow continued. In some cases, violence followed. But the demonstration changed public perception. It showed that resistance could be organized and peaceful.</p>

  <p>In 1990 and 1991, all three Baltic states declared independence. After a failed coup attempt in Moscow, the Soviet Union collapsed. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania regained sovereignty.</p>

  <p>The Baltic Way became a symbol of nonviolent protest. It proved that unity could challenge empires. It showed that ordinary people could shape history without force.</p>

  <p>Today, the Baltic Way is remembered as a turning point. It represents courage, patience, and collective action. The image of two million people holding hands remains one of the most powerful moments of the late Cold War.</p>
