  <h2>Lucy Higgs Nichols: Life and Legacy</h2>

  <p>Lucy Higgs Nichols was born in 1838 in western Tennessee and spent her early years enslaved. Little was recorded about her childhood, but what is known comes from her own memories, the testimonies of Union soldiers, and stories preserved in her community in New Albany, Indiana. Her life changed in 1862 when she escaped slavery with her young daughter, crossing into Union lines near Bolivar, Tennessee. Seeking safety and work, she joined the 23rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry, initially serving as a cook and laundress. Her dedication and compassion soon expanded her role to caring for the sick and wounded in hospitals and field camps.</p>

  <p>Lucy stayed with the regiment throughout the Civil War. She witnessed battles across West Tennessee, Northern Mississippi, and during the siege of Vicksburg, she endured the heartbreaking loss of her daughter to smallpox. Soldiers of the 23rd helped bury her child, and her actions and presence left a lasting impression on the men she served. They considered her part of their regiment even though she was never officially enlisted or paid. Her courage and service earned her the affectionate title of Aunt Lucy among the soldiers. She walked alongside them, cleaned their wounds, comforted the dying, and provided stability in the chaos of war.</p>

  <p>After the war, Lucy settled in New Albany, Indiana, supporting herself as a domestic worker and nurse. She married John Nichols and became known as Lucy Higgs Nichols. Veterans welcomed her to reunions and ceremonies, treating her as one of their own. In the 1880s and 1890s, she fought for a government pension for her service. Though initially denied because she had no official papers, she gained support from the soldiers who remembered her care. Congress eventually passed a private relief bill granting her a small monthly pension, recognizing her contribution and sacrifice. Even a modest pension was an acknowledgment of her courage and devotion during the war years.</p>

  <p>Lucy Higgs Nichols died in 1915 in New Albany. Her funeral was attended by many of her former comrades who honored her life and service in a public tribute that highlighted her unique role as a Black woman who had endured slavery and devoted herself to the Union cause. Her story became a symbol of perseverance, care, and commitment in the face of adversity. Today, she is remembered through museum exhibitions, historical markers, and educational programs that preserve her legacy. Lucy’s life illustrates the human capacity for resilience, the power of compassion, and the importance of community support in overcoming injustice. Her courage in serving others during one of the darkest periods in American history continues to inspire generations to value empathy, service, and recognition for all who contribute to society.</p>
