  <h2>Black Wall Street: How Greenwood Rose and How It Was Destroyed</h2>

  <p>Before its destruction, the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma was one of the most successful Black communities in the United States. Known as Black Wall Street, it was built by formerly enslaved people and their descendants who created wealth in a country designed to deny them access to it. Greenwood was not symbolic success. It was real, functional, and visible.</p>

  <p>Greenwood grew rapidly in the early twentieth century. Segregation laws forced Black residents to build separate institutions, and they did so with speed and precision. The district had banks, grocery stores, hotels, newspapers, movie theaters, medical offices, and schools. Money circulated within the community. Business owners lived near their customers. Economic independence created stability and pride.</p>

  <p>Daily life in Greenwood reflected confidence. Families dressed well, children attended school, and businesses stayed open late. Property ownership was common. Churches and social organizations reinforced mutual support. This prosperity existed despite constant racial hostility from the surrounding white population, not because it was tolerated.</p>

  <p>The success of Black Wall Street generated resentment. Many white residents viewed Greenwood as a threat to racial hierarchy. Local newspapers frequently published inflammatory stories, and law enforcement ignored or encouraged harassment. The community understood this danger but believed that economic success and lawful behavior would provide protection.</p>

  <p>In May 1921, that illusion collapsed. A false accusation involving a Black teenager and a white woman was used as justification for violence. Rumors spread rapidly. Armed white mobs gathered, while Black residents attempted to defend their community. Local authorities failed to intervene and in some cases actively supported the attackers.</p>

  <p>Over the course of hours, Greenwood was systematically destroyed. Homes and businesses were looted and burned. Airplanes were reportedly used to drop incendiary devices. Thousands of residents were displaced. Hundreds were killed, though exact numbers remain unknown due to suppressed records and mass graves.</p>

  <p>The destruction was not spontaneous chaos. It was organized and deliberate. Fire departments refused to respond. Police disarmed Black residents while allowing white mobs to act freely. The goal was clear. Greenwood was not meant to recover.</p>

  <p>After the massacre, survivors were placed in detention camps. Insurance companies denied claims. City leaders attempted to seize the land for redevelopment. Despite these barriers, residents rebuilt parts of Greenwood through determination and collective effort, but it never regained its former scale or influence.</p>

  <p>The fall of Black Wall Street erased generational wealth. Families lost businesses, homes, and savings overnight. The broader impact extended beyond Tulsa. It sent a message nationwide that Black success would be punished if it challenged existing power structures.</p>

  <p>For decades, the massacre was omitted from textbooks and public memory. Survivors were silenced. Only recent efforts have begun to acknowledge the truth. The rise and destruction of Black Wall Street is not just a historical event. It is evidence of how prosperity can be built under oppression and how quickly it can be taken when violence replaces law.</p>
