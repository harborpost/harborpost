  <h2>Fannie Lou Hamer and the Long Fight for the Right to Vote</h2>

  <p>Fannie Lou Hamer was born in 1917 in Montgomery County, Mississippi. She grew up on a plantation in the Mississippi Delta. Her parents were sharecroppers who worked land they did not own. The family lived in constant poverty. From childhood, Hamer learned that survival required long hours of labor.</p>

  <p>She began picking cotton at the age of six. School came second to work. By the time she was twelve, she left school entirely to help support her family. Like many Black children in the South, her education was cut short by economic need.</p>

  <p>As an adult, Hamer continued working on plantations. She married Perry Hamer and settled into a life shaped by segregation and limited opportunity. Jim Crow laws controlled nearly every aspect of daily life. Black citizens were excluded from political power and denied basic rights.</p>

  <p>Voting was nearly impossible for Black Mississippians. Officials used literacy tests, poll taxes, and intimidation to block registration. Even attempting to register could cost someone their job, their home, or their life. Many people stayed silent out of fear.</p>

  <p>In 1962, Hamer attended a meeting held by civil rights organizers. For the first time, she was told that the law said she had the right to vote. The idea shocked her. No one had ever explained this to her before. That night changed the direction of her life.</p>

  <p>Hamer joined a group traveling to the courthouse in Indianola to register. She was forced to take a literacy test. She failed, like most applicants. When she returned home, the plantation owner demanded she withdraw her registration attempt. When she refused, she was fired.</p>

  <p>With nowhere else to go, Hamer moved in with friends. Threats followed. Shots were fired into homes where she stayed. Violence became a constant risk. Still, she continued traveling and speaking about voting rights.</p>

  <p>In 1963, Hamer was arrested while returning from a training session. While jailed, she was brutally beaten by police and other inmates. The attack caused permanent damage to her body. She never fully recovered. She later said the beating left her with daily pain.</p>

  <p>Instead of silencing her, the violence strengthened her resolve. Hamer became a field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. She helped organize voter registration drives across Mississippi. She spoke in churches, homes, and meeting halls.</p>

  <p>Hamer was not a trained speaker. She used plain language. She spoke from personal experience. Her honesty made her powerful. Crowds listened because she sounded like them.</p>

  <p>In 1964, Hamer helped found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. The group challenged the state’s all white Democratic delegation. Their goal was to expose voter suppression on a national stage.</p>

  <p>At the Democratic National Convention, Hamer testified before the credentials committee. Her testimony was broadcast on television. She described beatings, arrests, and fear. She asked whether America was truly a land of freedom.</p>

  <p>President Lyndon Johnson attempted to interrupt the broadcast. The testimony aired anyway. Millions of Americans watched. Many were shocked by what they heard.</p>

  <p>The Freedom Democratic Party was not seated. The compromise offered was rejected. Despite this, the impact was immediate. Public pressure increased. The federal government could no longer ignore Southern violence.</p>

  <p>In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. The law outlawed literacy tests and allowed federal oversight of elections in discriminatory states. Voter registration surged. Black political participation expanded rapidly.</p>

  <p>Hamer did not stop after the law passed. She believed voting was only one part of freedom. She worked on economic justice, housing, and access to food. She helped establish the Freedom Farm Cooperative to support poor families.</p>

  <p>Health problems followed her for years. The injuries from jail and years of poverty took a toll. Despite this, she continued speaking and organizing until her death in 1977.</p>

  <p>Fannie Lou Hamer never held national office. She never sought personal recognition. Her legacy comes from courage and persistence. She proved that change could begin with one person refusing to accept injustice.</p>

  <p>The Voting Rights Act remains one of the most significant civil rights laws in American history. Its passage was not inevitable. It was forced into existence by people like Fannie Lou Hamer who risked everything to make democracy real.</p>
