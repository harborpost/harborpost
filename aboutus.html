  <h2>About Harbor Post</h2>

  <p><strong>Harbor Post</strong> is a media project focused on underrepresented and overlooked history.</p>

  <p>Across different formats, Harbor Post explores historical events, people, and movements that are often missing from mainstream narratives. These histories continue to shape political and social debates today, even when they are rarely acknowledged.</p>

  <p>The goal is to provide historical context that helps make sense of the present. Many modern discussions are rooted in past decisions, conflicts, and systems that are poorly understood without examining their origins.</p>

  <p>In a media environment driven by short clips and rapid commentary, Harbor Post emphasizes learning, context, and long-term perspective. Understanding history, especially histories that are frequently overlooked, is essential to understanding the world as it exists now.</p>
