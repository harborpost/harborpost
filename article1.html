  <h2>The Life of Lucy Higgs Nichols: From Slavery to Memory</h2>
  <p>Lucy Higgs Nichols was born into slavery in western Tennessee around 1838, probably in Hardeman County. Like most enslaved people, very little was written about her early life, and the few records that do exist were made by the people who owned her. We know her story mostly through what she later told others, what Union veterans remembered about her, and what her community in New Albany, Indiana, passed down after the Civil War. Over time she became known by several names. In the army she was simply “Lucy.” Later she used “Lucy Higgs,” and after she married John Nichols, she became “Lucy Higgs Nichols.” To the Union soldiers she lived with, especially the 23rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry, she was affectionately called “Aunt Lucy.”</p>

  <h2>Escape to Freedom in 1862</h2>
  <p>In the summer of 1862 Lucy made the dangerous decision to escape slavery. With her young daughter, called either Mona or Mollie in sources, she crossed into Union lines near Bolivar, Tennessee. She asked the soldiers of the 23rd Indiana for protection and for work. They took her in, and at first she served as a cook and laundress. But soon her role expanded, and she began to work as a nurse. She cleaned wounds, cared for sick soldiers, and comforted the dying in hospitals that were often understaffed and overwhelmed.</p>

  <h2>Life With the 23rd Indiana (1862–1865)</h2>
  <p>Lucy stayed with the regiment for the rest of the war. Their movements provide the outline of her life during those years. In 1862 the regiment fought in West Tennessee and Northern Mississippi. Disease was everywhere, and Lucy was put to work in the camps and hospitals. In the winter of 1862–63 the soldiers took part in bloody battles at Chickasaw Bayou and Arkansas Post. Lucy continued to help treat the wounded. During the siege of Vicksburg in the summer of 1863, Lucy suffered her greatest personal loss. Her daughter contracted smallpox and died. Soldiers of the 23rd helped bury the child near the battlefield. Veterans never forgot this act, and it became a powerful memory whenever they gathered with Lucy later in life. After Vicksburg the regiment fought in Mississippi and then moved into the Atlanta Campaign. Lucy was with them through those marches, continuing her work. When the war ended in 1865, the men of the regiment considered her one of their own, even though she had never been officially enlisted or paid in the same way they were.</p>

  <h2>Building a Life in New Albany</h2>
  <p>After the war Lucy moved to New Albany, Indiana, where many veterans of the 23rd had settled. She supported herself as a domestic worker and nurse. In New Albany she married John Nichols and added his last name to hers. Veterans welcomed her at reunions and gatherings of the Grand Army of the Republic, the main Union veterans’ organization. She was even made an honorary member of the 23rd Indiana Regimental Association. In group photographs she was always placed at the center, a sign of the respect and affection the men held for her.</p>

  <h2>Fighting for a Pension</h2>
  <p>In the 1880s and 1890s the government began to award pensions to nurses who had worked during the Civil War. Lucy applied, but her application was denied again and again. Officials said she had never been officially enrolled as a nurse and had no papers proving her service. Veterans of the 23rd came to her defense. They signed sworn statements that she had cared for them during battles and outbreaks of disease. Eventually Congress took up her case and passed a private relief bill just for her. She received a pension of twelve dollars a month. Although the amount was small, it was important recognition of her sacrifice and service.</p>

  <h2>Death and Funeral</h2>
  <p>Lucy died in New Albany in January 1915. Her funeral was attended by her old comrades, who came in full Grand Army of the Republic ritual. They buried her with honors in a local cemetery. This public tribute showed how deeply they valued her, especially at a time when Black women were rarely honored in civic spaces.</p>

  <h2>Remembering Lucy</h2>
  <p>In later years Lucy’s story became an important part of local and national history. The Carnegie Center for Art and History in New Albany created an exhibition called Remembered: The Life of Lucy Higgs Nichols. The Indiana Historical Bureau placed a historical marker in her honor. The National Park Service includes her in materials about Civil War nurses and African American women’s labor. Today her story is used to teach about slavery, women’s contributions in war, and the struggle for recognition after the conflict.</p>

  <h2>Why Her Story Matters</h2>
  <p>Lucy Higgs Nichols’s life shows how the Civil War was not just about battles and generals but also about ordinary people who made extraordinary choices. She freed herself and her child, she worked tirelessly as a nurse, and she built a life in freedom after the war. Her long fight for a pension reveals how racism and bureaucracy often erased the contributions of Black women, but it also shows the power of community support. Her comrades never forgot her, and because of them, neither have we.</p>
