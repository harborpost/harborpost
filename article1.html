  <div class="article-title">HISTORY OF THE SARI.</div>
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      The sari is one of the oldest surviving garments in the world. Its history stretches back more than 5,000 years, rooted in the Indus Valley Civilization. Early statues and carvings from that period show women wrapped in long, unstitched cloth. That simple idea—draping fabric around the body—became the foundation of the sari.
Over centuries, the sari absorbed influences from trade, conquest, and craft. Ancient texts like the Rig Veda mention woven garments of fine cotton. Later, as silk spread through India, weaving traditions evolved. Different regions began experimenting with dyes, motifs, and techniques. Bengal mastered muslin so fine it was called “woven air.” Gujarat perfected bandhani tie-dye. Kanchipuram weavers in Tamil Nadu created thick silk saris that shimmered with gold thread. Each style carried a distinct identity, reflecting local culture and artistry.
The Mughals added new layers. They popularized rich silks and elaborate embroidery. Court life under their rule celebrated textiles as symbols of power and prestige. Later, during colonial times, industrial mills threatened handlooms. Yet women continued to wear saris daily, keeping the craft alive even as politics and economics shifted.
The sari has never been just clothing. It has been a statement of tradition, resistance, and creativity. During India’s independence movement, khadi saris became a symbol of self-reliance. In the post-independence decades, film stars turned saris into icons of glamour. Today, designers push the sari into new territory—pre-stitched versions, experimental draping styles, and blends with modern fabrics. Yet the core idea remains the same: a length of cloth that transforms with the person who wears it.
The sari endures because it adapts. It can be everyday wear for a farmer, festive attire for a wedding, or high fashion on a global runway. It carries memory, artistry, and identity, yet never loses its elegance. After thousands of years, the sari is not a relic of history. It is still alive, still changing, still worn with pride..
