  <h2>The Fall of Saigon: How a City Collapsed in Real Time</h2>

  <p>The fall of Saigon in April 1975 was not a single dramatic moment. It was a rapid breakdown that unfolded hour by hour as institutions failed and civilians realized that the government protecting them no longer existed. What looked sudden from the outside was the final stage of a collapse already underway.</p>

  <p>For years, South Vietnam depended heavily on American military and financial support. When that support was reduced and then withdrawn, the state lost its foundation. Morale in the South Vietnamese army weakened, corruption drained resources, and confidence in leadership eroded. Ordinary people felt this long before the final days, through shortages, inflation, and constant uncertainty.</p>

  <p>As North Vietnamese forces advanced in early 1975, entire cities fell with little resistance. Refugees flooded southward, overwhelming roads and towns. These movements were not organized evacuations. They were families running with whatever they could carry. Each retreat signaled to civilians that the front line was closer than officials admitted.</p>

  <p>In Saigon itself, daily life continued outwardly, but panic grew beneath the surface. People lined up at embassies, searched for foreign contacts, and sold possessions to buy escape. Rumors spread faster than official announcements. The government tried to project calm, but few believed it.</p>

  <p>When evacuation plans began, they were chaotic by necessity. There was no way to move everyone who feared retribution. Helicopters became symbols of hope and despair at the same time. Crowds gathered wherever they believed aircraft might land. Families were separated. Decisions were made in seconds that determined who left and who stayed.</p>

  <p>American personnel destroyed documents, disabled equipment, and prepared to leave. These actions sent a clear signal to the population. If the strongest ally was leaving, the city was finished. Fear spread quickly, but so did resignation. Many civilians stopped trying to flee once they realized there was no system left to appeal to.</p>

  <p>As North Vietnamese troops entered the city, there was little fighting. The South Vietnamese government collapsed internally before it collapsed militarily. Orders were ignored or never given. Soldiers abandoned uniforms. Police vanished from the streets. Power shifted not through combat, but through absence.</p>

  <p>For ordinary people, the fall was deeply personal. Some burned photographs and documents. Others stayed inside, waiting. Many feared punishment for past associations, while others hoped life would simply become predictable again. Survival replaced ideology.</p>

  <p>The speed of Saigon’s collapse came from accumulated weakness. A state held together by external support cannot endure once that support disappears. When trust in leadership evaporates, authority follows. By the time tanks reached the city center, the outcome was already decided.</p>

  <p>The fall of Saigon marked the end of a war, but not the end of its consequences. For millions, it began a new period of uncertainty, displacement, and adaptation. The city did not fall because it was conquered street by street. It fell because the structures that governed it stopped functioning, and the people knew it before anyone else.</p>
