  <h2>Indigenous Boarding Schools: How Education Was Used as Control</h2>

  <p>Indigenous boarding schools were not created to educate in the traditional sense. They were designed to break cultures, separate families, and reshape identity. Established across North America and other colonized regions, these institutions targeted Indigenous children with the explicit goal of assimilation. The harm they caused was not accidental. It was structural.</p>

  <p>Before boarding schools, Indigenous education was community-based. Knowledge was passed through families, elders, language, and daily life. Skills were tied to land, survival, and collective responsibility. Colonial governments viewed this independence as a threat. Education became a tool to remove children from their cultures and replace Indigenous identity with obedience to the state.</p>

  <p>Children were often taken by force. Parents who resisted faced punishment, loss of rations, or imprisonment. Many children were transported far from their homes, sometimes hundreds of miles away. The separation was sudden and traumatic. For many families, there was no clear timeline for return.</p>

  <p>Upon arrival, children were stripped of personal belongings. Hair was cut. Traditional clothing was replaced with uniforms. Indigenous names were replaced with numbers or English names. Speaking native languages was forbidden and punished. These practices were meant to erase connection to home and reinforce submission.</p>

  <p>Daily life inside the schools was harsh. Schedules were rigid. Discipline was enforced through fear. Education focused on manual labor and domestic service rather than academic advancement. Boys were trained for agricultural or industrial work. Girls were trained for cleaning, sewing, and caregiving. The goal was to prepare children for low-status roles within colonial society.</p>

  <p>Neglect and abuse were widespread. Overcrowding, poor nutrition, and disease were common. Many children died from illness, malnutrition, or mistreatment. Deaths were often unreported or hidden. Families were not always informed. Cemeteries were unmarked. The loss became a quiet, ongoing grief.</p>

  <p>The psychological impact extended beyond the schools themselves. Children who survived returned home disconnected from language, culture, and family structures. Many struggled to communicate with parents and elders. The skills they were taught did not prepare them for economic stability. Trauma carried into adulthood and into future generations.</p>

  <p>The speed at which damage occurred was tied to repetition and scale. Thousands of children passed through these institutions over decades. Harm was normalized. Abuse was rarely punished. The system continued because it was legally supported and socially ignored.</p>

  <p>For much of the twentieth century, these schools were absent from public history. Survivors were discouraged from speaking. Records were incomplete or destroyed. Only through testimony, investigation, and community pressure did the truth begin to surface.</p>

  <p>The legacy of Indigenous boarding schools is visible today in intergenerational trauma, language loss, and disrupted family structures. At the same time, Indigenous communities continue to reclaim education on their own terms. Language revitalization, cultural schools, and survivor-led truth efforts challenge the system that tried to erase them.</p>

  <p>Indigenous boarding schools were not a failure of education. They were a success of control. Understanding their rise and consequences requires listening to those who lived through them and recognizing that survival itself was an act of resistance.</p>
