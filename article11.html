  <h2>The Defenestration of Prague and Its Consequences</h2>

  <p>In 1618, a tense political and religious conflict in Bohemia erupted into a dramatic act that changed the course of European history. Protestant nobles, frustrated by the restrictions placed on their religious freedoms by the Catholic Habsburg rulers, confronted officials inside Prague Castle. In a moment that has been remembered ever since, they threw two Catholic governors and their secretary out of a castle window. The fall was shocking, nearly miraculous as the men survived, reportedly landing on a pile of manure, but the act symbolized a profound rejection of authority and intolerance.</p>

  <p>The incident, now known as the Second Defenestration of Prague, was not just a sudden outburst of anger. It reflected years of rising tension between Protestants and Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire. The Bohemian Protestants felt their rights were being ignored and feared the loss of their religious autonomy. By physically removing the representatives of the emperor, they sent a message that would reverberate far beyond the walls of the castle. This bold action marked the beginning of the Bohemian Revolt and set the stage for a larger conflict that engulfed much of Europe.</p>

  <p>Following the defenestration, Bohemia declared resistance against Habsburg rule, and Protestant forces began organizing military action to defend their communities. The emperor responded with armies to suppress the rebellion, and what started as a regional dispute escalated quickly. Neighboring states took sides based on religious and political alliances, turning the conflict into a European-wide war. Within a few years, what began as a dramatic protest in Prague became the Thirty Years War, a devastating conflict that reshaped borders, economies, and populations across the continent.</p>

  <p>The defenestration showed how a single moment of courage and rebellion could spark immense consequences. The act became symbolic of the struggle between religious freedom and political authority, and its story was told repeatedly as a lesson in both resistance and the costs of conflict. The survival of the thrown officials became part of the legend, emphasizing how unpredictably events can unfold. In the end, the defenestration set in motion wars that would last decades, illustrating the fragile balance of power, faith, and governance in early modern Europe.</p>
